# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 5 if the number is greater than 80, 
# prints 4 if the number is greater than 60, prints 3 if the number is greater than 40, 
# prints 2 if the number is greater than 20, and prints 1 otherwise (only one print statement should occur).
x = 88
if x > 80 
    puts 5
elsif x > 60
    puts 4
elsif x > 40
    puts 3
elsif x > 20
    puts 2
else
    puts 1
end

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
