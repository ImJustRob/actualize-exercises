# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 100 if either number is greater than 10, and prints -100 otherwise.
number1 = 50
number2 = 14
if number1 > 10 || number2 > 10
    puts 100
else
    puts -100
end


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# everything was relatively easy the only thing is i forgot the symbol between number1 and number2
