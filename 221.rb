# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Write a program that uses variables to store two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.
x = "carl"
y = "sam"
puts x.upcase + y.upcase


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

#Yes it was easy to solve, I would probably practice tomorrow how to add veriables into a longer sentance with spaces.
