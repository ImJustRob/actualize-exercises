# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Use variables to store two numbers, 
# then write a condition that prints 1 if the first number is less than zero and the second number is greater than 0, 
# and prints 0 otherwise.
x = -3
y = 10
if x < 0 && y > 0
    puts 1
else 
    puts 0
end

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
