# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
#Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 9 if the number is less than 10,
#prints 19 if the number is less than 20, prints 29 if the number is less than 30, and prints -1 otherwise 
#(only one print statement should occur).
number = 31
if number < 10
    puts 9
elsif number < 20
    puts 19
elsif number < 30
    puts 29
else
    puts -1
end

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# like 90% of this problem was easy but i did forget youre able to put miltiple elsif conditions besides that everything was simple.
