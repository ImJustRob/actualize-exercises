# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Write a program that uses a variable to store a number, then prints the number times 10.
x = 15 
puts x * 10


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

#i did figure it out but i did forget where to put the * symbol i made a line that said x = 15 * 10 then tried to do puts x but it gave me 15 so i shifted everything to 1 line and it made more sense.
# i feel likei just need to take my time with problem solving i try to rush instead of taking my time.
