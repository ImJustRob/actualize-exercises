# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Write a program that uses variables to store the names of three cities, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).
city1 = "new york" 
city2 = "florida"
city3 = "georgia"
puts "my 3 favorite cities are" " " + city1 + ", " + city2 + ", and " + city3 
# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
