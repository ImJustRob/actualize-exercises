# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string interpolation (the #{} operator).
x = "red"
y = "green"
z = "blue"
puts "my favorite colors is #{x}, #{y} and #{z}."
# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# this one was relitively easy because i already solved it yesterday. I will practice conditions tomorrow.
