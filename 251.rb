# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".
puts "input a word"
word = gets.chomp
if word == "marco"
    puts "polo"
end
# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# this one wasnt so easy and i had everything right except when i put equals i only put 1 instead of 2. I have to remember the small details.
