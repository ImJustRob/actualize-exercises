# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 1776 if the number is less than 0, and prints 1979 otherwise.
x = 5
if x < 0
    puts 1776
else
    puts 1979
end
# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
#this one was pretty easy to remember ill try a different condition tomorrow.
