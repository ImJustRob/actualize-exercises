# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the numbers are both less than 10, and prints 0 otherwise.
x = 7
y = 6
if x < 10 && y < 10
    puts 1
else
    puts 0
end

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# for most of it part i completed this entire problem only issue i ran into was line 7 my if statement looked like this if x, y < 10 instead of how it looked now.
