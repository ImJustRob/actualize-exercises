# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Use a variable to store a number, 
# then write a condition that prints 100 if the number equals 100, 
# prints 99 if the number is equal to 99, and prints 0 otherwise.
number = 100
if number == 100
    puts 100
elsif number == 99
    puts 99
else
    puts 0
end

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
