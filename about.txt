My name is robert lothian im 30 years old. Im from new york but for the past 11 years ive been living in florida. I work for a video and lighting manufacturer in their product developement department. I joined actualize to start a new career path, I have a friend that actually attended actualize and he sparked my interest to start learning code and attend this actualize bootcamp. From the small amount of code ive learned on my own its challanging but also very interesting. I'm not quite sure yet what kind of job i will eventually be looking for but im sure i would figure that out during this bootcamp.
